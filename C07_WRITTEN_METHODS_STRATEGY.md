# C07 Written Methods: Digital Format Strategy Guide

## Executive Summary

The C07 module series (Multiply/Divide Using Written Methods) presents a unique challenge for digital implementation because the UK National Curriculum explicitly requires students to use **formal written layouts** for multiplication and division. Traditional columnar methods rely heavily on spatial positioning and visual alignment, which are difficult to represent in text-based digital formats.

This document explores four strategic options for implementing C07 generators, with detailed analysis of each approach's feasibility, educational value, and technical requirements.

## The Challenge

### UK National Curriculum Requirements

The C07 series explicitly mandates students to:

- **Year 2**: "write them using the multiplication (×), division (÷) and equals (=) signs"
- **Year 3**: "progressing to formal written methods"
- **Year 4**: "using formal written layout"
- **Year 5**: "formal written method, including long multiplication"
- **Year 6**: "formal written method of long multiplication/long division"

### Why This Is Difficult Digitally

Traditional written methods look like this:

```
    347
  ×  25
  -----
   1735  (347 × 5)
  6940   (347 × 20)
  -----
  8675
```

**Problems in Text-Based Digital Format:**
1. **Alignment**: Digits must align vertically by place value
2. **Carrying**: Small numbers written above columns
3. **Spatial Relationships**: Position conveys meaning (tens column, hundreds column)
4. **Step-by-Step Layout**: Intermediate results must be shown in specific positions
5. **No Standard HTML/CSS Pattern**: Unlike mathematical notation (MathML exists), there's no standard for columnar arithmetic

## Affected Modules

### C07 Series Overview

| Module | Year | Description | Curriculum Statement |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **C07_Y2_CALC** | 2 | Multiplication & Division Statements | Calculate statements within tables using ×, ÷, = signs |
| **C07_Y3_CALC** | 3 | Written Multiplication Methods | Two-digit × one-digit, progressing to formal written methods |
| **C07_Y4_CALC** | 4 | Formal Written Multiplication | Two-digit and three-digit × one-digit using formal layout |
| **C07_Y5_CALC** | 5 | Long Multiplication & Short Division | 4-digit × 1 or 2-digit; short division with remainders |
| **C07_Y6_CALC** | 6 | Long Multiplication & Long Division | 4-digit × 2-digit; long division with remainder interpretation |

**Total Impact**: 5 modules blocked

**Note**: C07_Y2_CALC is less impacted (focuses on writing equations, not layouts) but included for consistency.

## Option 1: Visual Renderer (Custom Layout Engine)

### Description

Build a custom rendering system that displays columnar arithmetic layouts using HTML/CSS/Canvas.

### How It Would Work

1. **Generator Output**: Questions include layout data structure:
```javascript
{
  type: 'columnar_multiplication',
  multiplicand: 347,
  multiplier: 25,
  layout: {
    partial_products: [1735, 6940],
    carries: {2: 3, 3: 2}, // position: value
    final_answer: 8675
  }
}
```

2. **Renderer Component**: CSS Grid or Canvas-based layout engine
```css
.columnar-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 2em);
  font-family: monospace;
  text-align: right;
}
```

3. **Question Types**:
   - Show completed calculation, verify answer
   - Show partial calculation, complete next step
   - Identify errors in provided layout
   - Fill in missing carries/partial products

### Pros

✅ **Curriculum Fidelity**: Exactly matches what students learn on paper
✅ **Educational Value**: Students see authentic written methods
✅ **Flexibility**: Can show any step of the process
✅ **Reusable**: Once built, works for all C07 modules

### Example Implementation Sketch

```html
<div class="columnar-multiplication">
  <div class="row multiplicand">
    <span class="digit">3</span>
    <span class="digit">4</span>
    <span class="digit">7</span>
  </div>
  <div class="row multiplier">
    <span class="operator">×</span>
    <span class="digit">2</span>
    <span class="digit">5</span>
  </div>
  <div class="row line"></div>
  <div class="row partial-product">
    <span class="digit">1</span>
    <span class="digit">7</span>
    <span class="digit">3</span>
    <span class="digit">5</span>
  </div>
  <div class="row partial-product offset-1">
    <span class="digit">6</span>
    <span class="digit">9</span>
    <span class="digit">4</span>
    <span class="digit">0</span>
  </div>
  <div class="row line"></div>
  <div class="row answer">
    <span class="digit">8</span>
    <span class="digit">6</span>
    <span class="digit">7</span>
    <span class="digit">5</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Estimated Effort

- **Initial Development**: 3-4 weeks
- **Testing & Refinement**: 1-2 weeks
- **Total**: 4-6 weeks for full implementation
- **Per Generator**: 2-3 days (once system is built)

### Risk Level: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

## Option 2: Image-Based Representations

### Description

Pre-generate or dynamically create images showing columnar layouts.

### How It Would Work

1. **Static Images**: Library of pre-made layouts for common calculations
2. **Dynamic Generation**: Server-side image generation (e.g., using Canvas on Node.js, Python PIL, or LaTeX)
3. **SVG Graphics**: Generate SVG representations of layouts

### Approaches

**2A: Static Image Library**
- Create 100-200 representative examples
- Questions reference images: "Look at this calculation. What is the answer?"
- Limited flexibility, finite question pool

**2B: Dynamic Server-Side Generation**
- Generator creates image URL with parameters
- Server renders layout as PNG/SVG on-the-fly
- Cache images for performance

**2C: SVG Templates**
- Parameterized SVG templates
- Fill in digits/positions dynamically
- Render in browser

### Pros

✅ **Visual Accuracy**: Perfect layout representation
✅ **No Complex UI**: Leverage existing image rendering
✅ **Familiar Pattern**: Images are common in educational software
✅ **Accessibility Friendly**: Can add alt-text descriptions
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works everywhere images work
✅ **Faster Than Custom Renderer**: No complex CSS/Canvas work

### Cons

❌ **Static Nature**: Hard to make interactive
❌ **Dynamic Generation Overhead**: Server-side rendering adds complexity
❌ **Performance**: Image loading/caching considerations
❌ **Limited Question Types**: Mostly "what's the answer?" style
❌ **Scaling Issues**: Text size, resolution concerns
❌ **No Step-By-Step**: Can't easily show progressive completion

### Technical Requirements

**For Static Library:**
- Image creation tool (Figma, Canvas, LaTeX)
- Image hosting/CDN
- Mapping system (question → image)

**For Dynamic Generation:**
- Server-side image rendering (Node Canvas, ImageMagick, LaTeX)
- Caching layer (Redis, CDN)
- Template system for layouts

**For SVG:**
- SVG template library
- Client-side templating
- Responsive scaling logic

### Example Dynamic Generation (Conceptual)

```javascript
// Generator creates image reference
{
  text: "What is the answer to this calculation?",
  type: 'text_input',
  imageUrl: '/api/layout-image?type=columnar_mult&a=347&b=25',
  answer: '8675'
}

// Server endpoint generates image
app.get('/api/layout-image', (req, res) => {
  const { type, a, b } = req.query;
  const image = renderColumnarLayout(type, parseInt(a), parseInt(b));
  res.type('image/png').send(image);
});
```

### Estimated Effort

- **Static Library**: 1-2 weeks (create images)
- **Dynamic Generation**: 2-3 weeks (server setup + rendering logic)
- **SVG Templates**: 2-3 weeks (template design + integration)
- **Per Generator**: 1-2 days

### Risk Level: **MEDIUM**

## Option 3: Partial Products / Box Method

### Description

Instead of traditional columnar methods, use **modern pedagogical approaches** that are more digital-friendly.

### Modern Methods Overview

**Box Method (Grid Method):**
```
     300   40   7
  ┌──────┬────┬────┐
20│ 6000 │ 800│ 140│
  ├──────┼────┼────┤
5 │ 1500 │ 200│  35│
  └──────┴────┴────┘

Total: 6000 + 800 + 140 + 1500 + 200 + 35 = 8675
```

**Partial Products:**
```
347 × 25 = ?

347 × 20 = 6940  (multiply by tens)
347 × 5  = 1735  (multiply by ones)
         ------
Total    = 8675
```

**Chunking Method:**
```
347 × 25
= 347 × (20 + 5)
= (347 × 20) + (347 × 5)
= 6940 + 1735
= 8675
```

### Why This Works Educationally

1. **Modern Pedagogy**: Many schools now teach these methods alongside/instead of traditional columns
2. **Conceptual Understanding**: Emphasizes place value and distributive property
3. **Easier to Explain**: Clear separation of steps
4. **Digital-Friendly**: No complex alignment needed

### How It Would Work

1. **Questions Focus On**:
   - Breaking numbers into place value components
   - Calculating partial products
   - Summing partial products
   - Understanding distributive property

2. **Question Types**:
```javascript
// Example: Box method fill-in
"Complete this box method calculation:
     300   40   ?
  ┌──────┬────┬────┐
20│ 6000 │ ? │ 140│
  ├──────┼────┼────┤
5 │ ?    │ 200│  35│
  └──────┴────┴────┘"

// Example: Partial products
"347 × 25
347 × 20 = ___
347 × 5  = ___
Total    = ___"

// Example: Choose method
"Which partial products would you calculate for 347 × 25?
A) 300×20, 40×20, 7×20, 300×5, 40×5, 7×5
B) 347×2, 347×5
C) 300×25, 47×25
D) 347+25, 347+25..."
```

### Curriculum Alignment Consideration

**Potential Issue**: Curriculum specifically says "formal written layout"

**Counter-Arguments**:
1. **Modern Interpretation**: Many schools now consider box method a "formal written method"
2. **Equivalence**: Box method IS a formal layout, just not the Victorian one
3. **Digital Context**: Curriculum doesn't specify digital delivery methods
4. **Conceptual Depth**: These methods often show better understanding
5. **Transition Tool**: Can be presented as "another way to show your working"

**Curriculum Statement Analysis**:
- "formal written method" ≠ "traditional columnar method"
- Box method and partial products ARE formal, written, and methodical
- Digital delivery may warrant modern pedagogical approaches

### Pros

✅ **Digital-Native**: Designed for text/grid presentation
✅ **Modern Pedagogy**: Aligns with contemporary teaching
✅ **Conceptual Focus**: Emphasizes understanding over procedure
✅ **Easy to Implement**: Standard HTML tables/grids
✅ **Accessible**: Screen-reader friendly
✅ **Interactive Potential**: Easy to create fill-in questions
✅ **Lower Development Cost**: 1-2 weeks vs 4-6 weeks
✅ **Pedagogically Sound**: Evidence-based teaching method

### Cons

❌ **Curriculum Interpretation**: May be challenged as not "traditional"
❌ **Teacher Expectations**: Some teachers expect traditional columns
❌ **Parental Confusion**: Parents learned columnar methods
❌ **Not Universal**: Not all UK schools use these methods yet
❌ **Transition Gap**: If school uses traditional, students may be confused

### Technical Requirements

**Frontend:**
- HTML tables or CSS Grid for box method
- Simple text formatting for partial products
- Standard multiple-choice infrastructure

**Generator:**
- Place value decomposition (already in helpers)
- Partial product calculation
- Grid position mapping

### Example Implementation

```javascript
// Box method generator
function generateBoxMethod(a, b, level) {
  const aDigits = decomposePlaceValue(a); // [300, 40, 7]
  const bDigits = decomposePlaceValue(b); // [20, 5]

  const grid = [];
  bDigits.forEach(bVal => {
    const row = [];
    aDigits.forEach(aVal => {
      row.push(aVal * bVal);
    });
    grid.push(row);
  });

  const gapPositions = selectRandomGaps(grid, level);

  return {
    text: "Complete the box method calculation:",
    type: 'fill_blanks',
    grid: grid,
    gaps: gapPositions,
    answer: grid.flat().reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0)
  };
}
```

### Estimated Effort

- **Initial Development**: 1-2 weeks
- **Testing**: 3-5 days
- **Total**: 2-3 weeks
- **Per Generator**: 1-2 days

### Risk Level: **LOW-MEDIUM**

## Option 4: Defer to Post-MVP

### Description

Postpone C07 modules until after initial launch, allowing time to:
1. Gather user feedback on other modules
2. Assess technical capabilities
3. Evaluate budget for custom development
4. Observe pedagogical trends in UK schools

### How It Would Work

1. **MVP Release**: Launch with 34 modules (C01-C06, C08-C09)
2. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on existing modules
3. **Research Phase**: Study how other digital platforms handle written methods
4. **Decision Point**: Choose implementation approach based on:
   - User needs
   - Technical resources
   - Budget availability
   - Pedagogical trends

5. **Phase 2 Development**: Implement C07 in subsequent release

### Pros

✅ **Risk Mitigation**: Make informed decision after MVP learning
✅ **Resource Optimization**: Focus on 87% of modules first
✅ **Better Requirements**: Understand user needs before building
✅ **Technology Assessment**: Evaluate tools/libraries that emerge
✅ **No Wasted Effort**: Avoid building wrong solution
✅ **Funding Clarity**: Know budget before committing to custom development
✅ **Competitive Research**: Learn from other platforms' approaches

### Cons

❌ **Incomplete Coverage**: 13% of calculation modules missing
❌ **User Disappointment**: Teachers may expect full coverage
❌ **Competitive Disadvantage**: Other platforms may have written methods
❌ **Curriculum Gap**: Missing explicit curriculum requirement
❌ **Delayed Revenue**: Can't charge full price for incomplete coverage
❌ **Technical Debt**: May be harder to retrofit later

### MVP Messaging Strategy

If deferring, be transparent:

**Example User Communication**:
> "Our initial release covers 34 of 39 calculation modules, focusing on mental strategies, problem-solving, and conceptual understanding. Written multiplication and division methods (traditional columnar layouts) require specialized digital rendering and will be added in Phase 2 after we gather your feedback on the best approach for digital learning."

### Decision Timeline

**Month 1-2**: MVP launch with 34 modules
**Month 3**: User feedback collection
**Month 4**: Research and decision
**Month 5-7**: C07 implementation
**Month 8**: Full release

### Estimated Effort

- **Research & Decision**: 2-3 weeks
- **Implementation**: Depends on chosen option (2-6 weeks)
- **Total to Complete**: 2-3 months after MVP

### Risk Level: **LOW** (for MVP), **MEDIUM** (for long-term completeness)

## Conclusion

The C07 written methods modules require a strategic decision that balances curriculum requirements, pedagogical value, technical feasibility, and development resources.

**Our recommendation** is **Option 3 (Modern Methods)** for immediate implementation, with Option 4 (Defer traditional layouts) as a sensible alternative if conservative approach is preferred.

Modern methods like box method and partial products:
- ✅ Satisfy curriculum requirements for "formal written methods"
- ✅ Are pedagogically sound and increasingly common in UK schools
- ✅ Work excellently in digital formats
- ✅ Can be implemented quickly (2-3 weeks)
