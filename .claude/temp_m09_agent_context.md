# Request: Create M09_MEAS Question Generators

Please create complete parameter definitions and generator code for the following five M09_MEAS (Measurement Problem Solving) modules:

## Module 1: M09_Y2_MEAS - Year 2 Measurement Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "solve simple problems in a practical context involving addition and subtraction of money of the same unit, including giving change"

**Context:**
- Year Group: Year 2
- Strand: Measurement - Problem Solving
- Focus is on MONEY ONLY at Year 2 (length/mass/capacity problems come in Year 3)
- Problems involve same unit (pence only OR pounds only, not mixed)
- Real-world contexts: shops, pocket money, saving, spending
- Includes giving change calculations

**Question types should include:**
- Simple addition: "A toy costs 35p. A book costs 22p. How much altogether?"
- Simple subtraction: "You have 50p. You spend 32p. How much left?"
- Giving change: "You buy something for 28p and pay with 50p. What change?"
- Word problems with practical contexts (shopping, saving)

**Key concepts:**
- Addition and subtraction within 100
- Same unit only (all pence OR all pounds, no mixing)
- Change = amount paid - cost
- Practical money vocabulary

**Difficulty progression:**
- Level 1: Pence only, values under 50p, simple addition/subtraction
- Level 2: Pence to 99p, introduces giving change with round amounts (50p, £1)
- Level 3: Pounds only (£1-£10), whole pounds, giving change
- Level 4: Pounds to £20, more complex change scenarios

## Module 2: M09_Y3_MEAS - Year 3 Measurement Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "add and subtract amounts of money to give change, using both pounds (£) and pence (p) in practical contexts; add and subtract lengths (m/cm/mm); add and subtract mass (kg/g); add and subtract volume / capacity (l/ml)"

**Context:**
- Year Group: Year 3
- Strand: Measurement - Problem Solving
- Now expands to ALL measurement types: money, length, mass, capacity
- Money can now mix pounds and pence (£2.35)
- Uses metric units for all measures

**Question types should include:**
- Money with mixed units: "£3.45 + £1.25 = ?"
- Giving change with pounds and pence: "Pay £5 for item costing £3.67"
- Length problems: "2m 35cm + 1m 48cm = ?"
- Mass problems: "1kg 200g + 500g = ?"
- Capacity problems: "2l 300ml - 1l 450ml = ?"
- Word problems across all four measurement types

**Key concepts:**
- Addition/subtraction with decimal notation for money (£2.35)
- Addition/subtraction with compound units (2m 35cm)
- Converting within same measurement system (e.g., 1m 35cm = 135cm)

**Difficulty progression:**
- Level 1: Simple same-unit problems (all pence, all cm, all g, all ml)
- Level 2: Mixed units within measure (£2.50, 2m 30cm), addition only
- Level 3: Mixed units, includes subtraction, may require conversion
- Level 4: Complex word problems, multiple steps, all four measurement types

## Module 3: M09_Y4_MEAS - Year 4 Measurement Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "calculate different measures, including money in pounds and pence"

**Context:**
- Year Group: Year 4
- Strand: Measurement - Problem Solving
- Broader "calculate" includes multiplication and division (not just add/subtract)
- All measurement types: money, length, mass, capacity
- More complex practical scenarios

**Question types should include:**
- Money calculations: "3 items at £1.25 each. Total cost?"
- Scaling problems: "One box weighs 2kg 500g. What do 4 boxes weigh?"
- Division problems: "Share £12.60 equally between 3 people"
- Length problems with multiplication: "5 pieces of ribbon, each 2m 35cm long"
- Capacity/mass problems: "Recipe needs 250ml milk for 2 servings. How much for 6 servings?"
- Multi-step problems combining operations

**Key concepts:**
- All four operations (×, ÷, +, -)
- Scaling (multiplying/dividing measures)
- Decimal notation for money
- Real-world contexts requiring multiple steps

**Difficulty progression:**
- Level 1: Simple multiplication/division, whole numbers
- Level 2: Decimal money, simple scaling (×2, ×3, ×5, ×10)
- Level 3: More complex scaling, division with remainders, mixed operations
- Level 4: Multi-step problems, larger numbers, all measurement types

## Module 4: M09_Y5_MEAS - Year 5 Measurement Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "use all four operations to solve problems involving measures [money] using decimal notation, including scaling; use all four operations to solve problems involving measure [e.g. length] using decimal notation, including scaling; use all four operations to solve problems involving measure [e.g. mass] using decimal notation, including scaling; use all four operations to solve problems involving measure [e.g. volume] using decimal notation, including scaling"

**Context:**
- Year Group: Year 5
- Strand: Measurement - Problem Solving
- All four operations across all measurement types
- Emphasis on DECIMAL NOTATION (not compound units)
- Scaling problems prominent
- More complex multi-step scenarios

**Question types should include:**
- Money: "4.5kg of apples at £2.40 per kg"
- Length: "A rectangle is 3.5m by 2.8m. What is the perimeter?"
- Mass: "Divide 5.6kg equally among 8 people"
- Capacity: "A tank holds 45.5 litres. It's filled to 2/3. How much water?"
- Scaling: "A recipe for 4 uses 1.5kg flour. How much for 6 servings?"
- Multi-step word problems with real contexts

**Key concepts:**
- Decimal notation (3.5m, not 3m 50cm)
- All four operations with decimals
- Scaling with non-integer multipliers
- Converting between units when needed

**Difficulty progression:**
- Level 1: One-step problems, decimals to 1 dp, simple operations
- Level 2: Two-step problems, decimals to 2 dp, introduces scaling
- Level 3: Multi-step problems, complex scaling, mixed operations
- Level 4: Advanced scenarios, 3+ steps, requires planning/strategy

- Money with conversions: "£156.50 converted to euros at rate £1 = €1.18"
- Length conversions: "Convert 3.456km to metres"
- Mass conversions: "A recipe needs 250g. You have 0.5kg. How much left?"
- Capacity with precision: "Tank holds 2.5m³. How many litres?" (1m³ = 1000 litres)
- Area/volume problems: "Room is 4.5m × 3.2m. Area in m²? In cm²?"
- Multi-step problems requiring multiple conversions

**Key concepts:**
- Converting between units (km↔m↔cm↔mm, kg↔g, l↔ml)
- Decimal precision to 3 decimal places (3.456)
- Complex multi-step scenarios
- Area (m² ↔ cm²) and volume (m³ ↔ cm³) conversions
- Real-world contexts (DIY, cooking, science experiments)

**Difficulty progression:**
- Level 1: Simple conversions, 1-2 dp, single unit change (km to m)
- Level 2: Two-step problems, 2-3 dp, multiple conversions possible
- Level 3: Multi-step with calculation + conversion, area/perimeter
- Level 4: Complex scenarios, volume conversions, requires strategic planning

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **Create ONE combined generator file**: All five year groups should be in a single generator file `M09_MEAS_problems.js` since they share the same module code (M09_MEAS) but differ by year group.

2. **Parameter structure**: Use a nested structure like:
```javascript
'M09_Y2_MEAS': { /* Year 2 parameters */ },
'M09_Y3_MEAS': { /* Year 3 parameters */ },
// etc.
```

3. **Generator function**: Should check the level to determine which year group and operations to use.

4. **Question types**: All should be `text_input` for numeric answers. Some may benefit from hints.

5. **Answer format**: Always return answer as a string. For money, include currency symbols in the question text but accept numeric answers (e.g., question asks "How many pounds?" or "How much in pence?").

6. **Real-world contexts**: Use age-appropriate scenarios (toys, pocket money, school trips, recipes, DIY projects).

7. **Progression across years**: Ensure clear vertical progression from Year 2 (simple money, same unit) to Year 6 (complex conversions, multiple steps).

Please create:
1. Complete parameter definitions for all five modules (M09_Y2_MEAS through M09_Y6_MEAS)
2. Complete generator code in a single file
3. Integration instructions for parameters.js and questionEngine.js
