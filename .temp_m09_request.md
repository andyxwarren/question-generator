# Request for M09 Measurement Problem-Solving Modules (Years 2-6)

## Overview
Create 5 complete curriculum modules for M09_MEAS series covering Years 2-6. These are problem-solving modules focused on applying measurement concepts (money, length, mass, capacity) through word problems and calculations.

## Module 1: M09_Y2_MEAS - Year 2 Money Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "solve simple problems in a practical context involving addition and subtraction of money of the same unit, including giving change"

**Key Requirements:**
- Money ONLY at Year 2 (length/mass/capacity come in Year 3)
- Same unit only (all pence OR all pounds, not mixed)
- Operations: addition and subtraction only
- Includes giving change calculations
- Real-world contexts (shopping, pocket money, saving)

**Question Types Needed:**
1. Simple addition: "A toy costs 35p. A book costs 22p. How much altogether?"
2. Simple subtraction: "You have 50p. You spend 32p. How much left?"
3. Giving change: "You buy something for 28p and pay with 50p. What change?"
4. Word problems with practical contexts

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Level 1: Pence only, values under 50p, simple addition/subtraction
- Level 2: Pence to 99p, introduces giving change with round amounts (50p, £1=100p)
- Level 3: Pounds only (£1-£10), whole pounds, giving change
- Level 4: Pounds to £20, more complex change scenarios

## Module 2: M09_Y3_MEAS - Year 3 Measurement Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "add and subtract amounts of money to give change, using both pounds (£) and pence (p) in practical contexts; add and subtract lengths (m/cm/mm); add and subtract mass (kg/g); add and subtract volume / capacity (l/ml)"

**Key Requirements:**
- Expands to ALL measurement types: money, length, mass, capacity
- Money can now mix pounds and pence (£2.35)
- Operations: addition and subtraction only
- Uses metric units for all measures

**Question Types Needed:**
1. Money with mixed units: "£3.45 + £1.25 = ?"
2. Giving change with pounds and pence: "Pay £5 for item costing £3.67"
3. Length problems: "2m 35cm + 1m 48cm = ?"
4. Mass problems: "1kg 200g + 500g = ?"
5. Capacity problems: "2l 300ml - 1l 450ml = ?"

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Level 1: Simple same-unit problems (all pence, all cm, all g, all ml)
- Level 2: Mixed units within measure (£2.50, 2m 30cm), addition only
- Level 3: Mixed units, includes subtraction, may require conversion
- Level 4: Complex word problems, multiple steps, all four measurement types

## Module 3: M09_Y4_MEAS - Year 4 Measurement Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "calculate different measures, including money in pounds and pence"

**Key Requirements:**
- "Calculate" includes multiplication and division (not just add/subtract)
- All measurement types: money, length, mass, capacity
- More complex practical scenarios
- Scaling problems

**Question Types Needed:**
1. Money calculations: "3 items at £1.25 each. Total cost?"
2. Scaling problems: "One box weighs 2kg 500g. What do 4 boxes weigh?"
3. Division problems: "Share £12.60 equally between 3 people"
4. Length problems with multiplication: "5 pieces of ribbon, each 2m 35cm long"
5. Multi-step problems combining operations

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Level 1: Simple multiplication/division, whole numbers
- Level 2: Decimal money, simple scaling (×2, ×3, ×5, ×10)
- Level 3: More complex scaling, division with remainders, mixed operations
- Level 4: Multi-step problems, larger numbers, all measurement types

## Module 4: M09_Y5_MEAS - Year 5 Measurement Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "use all four operations to solve problems involving measures [money] using decimal notation, including scaling; use all four operations to solve problems involving measure [e.g. length] using decimal notation, including scaling; use all four operations to solve problems involving measure [e.g. mass] using decimal notation, including scaling; use all four operations to solve problems involving measure [e.g. volume] using decimal notation, including scaling"

**Key Requirements:**
- All four operations across all measurement types
- Emphasis on DECIMAL NOTATION (not compound units)
- Scaling problems prominent
- More complex multi-step scenarios

**Question Types Needed:**
1. Money: "4.5kg of apples at £2.40 per kg"
2. Length: "A rectangle is 3.5m by 2.8m. What is the perimeter?"
3. Mass: "Divide 5.6kg equally among 8 people"
4. Capacity: "A tank holds 45.5 litres. It's filled to 2/3. How much water?"
5. Scaling: "A recipe for 4 uses 1.5kg flour. How much for 6 servings?"

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Level 1: One-step problems, decimals to 1 dp, simple operations
- Level 2: Two-step problems, decimals to 2 dp, introduces scaling
- Level 3: Multi-step problems, complex scaling, mixed operations
- Level 4: Advanced scenarios, 3+ steps, requires planning/strategy

## Module 5: M09_Y6_MEAS - Year 6 Measurement Problems

**Curriculum Statement:** "solve problems involving the calculation and conversion of units of measure, using decimal notation up to three decimal places where appropriate"

**Key Requirements:**
- Emphasis on CONVERSION between units
- Decimal notation to THREE decimal places
- Complex multi-step problems requiring conversions
- All measurement types including area and volume

**Question Types Needed:**
1. Money conversions: "£156.50 converted to euros at rate £1 = €1.18"
2. Length conversions: "Convert 3.456km to metres"
3. Mass conversions: "A recipe needs 250g. You have 0.5kg. How much left?"
4. Capacity with precision: "Tank holds 2.5m³. How many litres?" (1m³ = 1000 litres)
5. Area/volume: "Room is 4.5m × 3.2m. Area in m²? In cm²?"

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Level 1: Simple conversions, 1-2 dp, single unit change (km to m)
- Level 2: Two-step problems, 2-3 dp, multiple conversions possible
- Level 3: Multi-step with calculation + conversion, area/perimeter
- Level 4: Complex scenarios, volume conversions, strategic planning

## Implementation Notes

**Parameter Patterns to Use:**
- `operations`: Array of operation types (e.g., ['simple_addition', 'simple_subtraction', 'giving_change'])
- `measurement_types`: Array of measurement contexts (e.g., ['money', 'length', 'mass', 'capacity'])
- `value_ranges`: Object with min/max for each measurement type
- `units`: Array of units allowed at each level
- `problem_complexity`: 'single_step', 'two_step', 'multi_step'
- `requires_conversion`: boolean
- `decimal_places`: number (0-3 depending on year)

**Question Type Mix:**
- Direct calculations: "Calculate £3.45 + £2.67"
- Word problems: "Sarah has £5. She buys a book for £3.25. How much left?"
- Giving change: "You pay £10 for items costing £7.35. What change?"
- Scaling: "3 items cost £4.50. How much for 5 items?"
- Conversion: "Convert 2.5kg to grams"

**Helper Functions Needed:**
- `formatMoney(value, format)`: Format monetary values
- `formatMeasurement(value, unit, compoundFormat)`: Format measurements (e.g., 2m 35cm or 2.35m)
- `generateMeasurementContext()`: Create realistic contexts (shopping, cooking, DIY)
- `convertUnits(value, fromUnit, toUnit)`: Handle unit conversions

**Export Pattern:**
Each generator must export:
```javascript
export default {
    moduleId: 'M09_YX_MEAS',
    generate: generateQuestion
};
```

Please create complete parameter definitions and generator code for all 5 modules following the project's architecture.
