# UK Maths Practice - User Guide

## What is this application?

The UK Maths Practice Question Generator is an educational tool designed to create mathematics practice questions that align precisely with the **UK National Curriculum Framework**. The application automatically generates customized practice questions at different difficulty levels, helping students build mastery of mathematical concepts progressively.

## How does it align with the UK National Curriculum?

The UK National Curriculum for Mathematics is organized into specific learning objectives across six year groups (Years 1-6). The framework contains **338 individual curriculum statements** covering topics like:

- **Number and Place Value** (counting, reading/writing numbers, place value)
- **Calculations** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **Fractions, Decimals and Percentages**
- **Ratio and Proportion**
- **Algebra**
- **Measurement**
- **Geometry** (properties of shapes, position and direction)
- **Statistics**

Each curriculum statement is assigned a unique code (e.g., **N01_Y1_NPV** for "Year 1 Counting in Multiples" or **N02_Y3_NPV** for "Year 3 Numbers to 1000"). The app uses these codes to organize and generate questions that precisely match what students should be learning at each year level.

## Understanding Difficulty Levels

Every topic is divided into **4 progressive difficulty levels**, allowing students to build confidence and competence gradually:

### Level 1: Beginning ðŸŒ±
- **Who it's for**: Students just starting to learn the concept
- **What to expect**: Simpler numbers, shorter sequences, structured starting points
- **Example**: For Year 1 counting, students count from 0 to 20 in 1s and 2s, always starting from 0 or 20

### Level 2: Developing ðŸŒ¿
- **Who it's for**: Students who understand the basics and are building confidence
- **What to expect**: Larger number ranges, more variation, flexible starting points
- **Example**: For Year 1 counting, students count from 0 to 50 in 1s, 2s, and 5s, starting from any number

### Level 3: Meeting ðŸŒ³
- **Who it's for**: Students working at the expected curriculum standard
- **What to expect**: Full curriculum requirements, more complex patterns, multiple gaps to fill
- **Example**: For Year 1 counting, students count from 0 to 100 in 1s, 2s, 5s, and 10s with 2 missing numbers

### Level 4: Exceeding ðŸŒ²
- **Who it's for**: Students ready for greater depth and challenge
- **What to expect**: Extended ranges beyond curriculum minimum, additional complexity, more patterns
- **Example**: For Year 1 counting, students count from 0 to 200 including multiples of 3, with 3 missing numbers

## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Choose Your Topic

When you open the application, you'll see topics organized by:
- **Strand** (e.g., "Number and Place Value")
- **Substrand** (e.g., "Counting in multiples")
- **Year Group** (Years 1-6)

Topics are displayed in a grid where:
- Each **row** represents a different substrand
- Each **column** represents a year group
- **Empty cells** mean that topic isn't covered in that year

Click on any topic card to select it. Each card shows:
- The curriculum reference code (e.g., N01_Y3_NPV)
- The full curriculum description
- The year group it belongs to

### Step 2: Set Number of Questions

Before selecting a topic, you can choose how many questions you'd like for **each difficulty level**:
- Minimum: 1 question per level
- Maximum: 20 questions per level
- Default: 5 questions per level

For example, if you select "5 questions per level," the app will generate:
- 5 Beginning questions
- 5 Developing questions
- 5 Meeting questions
- 5 Exceeding questions
- **Total: 20 questions**

### Step 3: Answer the Questions

Questions are organized into **four sections**, one for each difficulty level. You can:
- Work through questions in order (Beginning â†’ Exceeding)
- Jump to any difficulty level
- Complete questions at your own pace

The app displays questions by level, with clear labels:
- **Beginning** (Level 1)
- **Developing** (Level 2)
- **Meeting** (Level 3)
- **Exceeding** (Level 4)

### Step 4: Submit Your Answers

Once you've completed your questions:
1. Click the **"Submit Answers"** button
2. The app immediately checks all your answers
3. Correct answers are highlighted in **green** âœ“
4. Incorrect answers are highlighted in **red** âœ— and show the correct answer
5. A **results summary** shows your overall score and performance by level

### Step 5: Review and Retry

After submission, you can:
- Review which questions you got right or wrong
- See the correct answers for any mistakes
- Click **"Reset"** to clear all answers and try again
- Click **"Generate New Questions"** to get a fresh set of questions on the same topic

## Types of Questions

The application generates three types of questions:

### 1. Fill in the Blanks
Complete a sequence by filling in missing numbers.

**Example**: Fill in the missing numbers: 2, 4, ___, 8, ___, 12
- **Answer**: 6, 10
- Students may need to fill one or more gaps depending on difficulty level

### 2. What Comes Next?
Continue a pattern by identifying the next number.

**Example**: What number comes next? 5, 10, 15, 20, ___
- **Answer**: 25
- Tests understanding of patterns and sequences

### 3. Multiple Choice
Select the correct answer from several options.

**Example**: Continue the pattern: 10, 20, 30, 40, ___
- Options: A) 45  B) 50  C) 55  D) 60
- **Answer**: B) 50
- Helps students recognize correct answers even if they're unsure

## How Answer Checking Works

The application uses smart validation to check answers:

### For Single-Answer Questions
- The app removes extra spaces and ignores capitalization
- Numeric answers allow tiny differences for decimal precision
- If your answer matches the correct answer, you get it right

### For Multiple-Gap Questions
- Enter all answers separated by commas (e.g., "6, 10, 15")
- The app checks each answer individually
- All gaps must be correct to get the question right
- The order of answers matters for sequences

### Feedback
- **Correct answers**: Display a green checkmark âœ“ with "Excellent work!"
- **Incorrect answers**: Display a red X âœ— with the message "Not quite. The answer is [correct answer]"
- **Blank answers**: No feedback shown until you submit

## Understanding Your Results

After submitting, you'll see:

### Overall Score
- **Format**: "Correct / Total (Percentage%)"
- **Example**: "15 / 20 (75%)"

### Score by Level
Shows performance for each difficulty level:
- **Level 1 (Beginning)**: 5/5 (100%)
- **Level 2 (Developing)**: 4/5 (80%)
- **Level 3 (Meeting)**: 3/5 (60%)
- **Level 4 (Exceeding)**: 3/5 (60%)

This breakdown helps identify:
- Which levels you've mastered
- Where you might need more practice
- How ready you are for greater challenge

## Tips for Success

1. **Start at the right level**: If you're new to a topic, focus on Beginning and Developing levels first
2. **Read carefully**: Pay attention to whether sequences count forwards or backwards
3. **Look for patterns**: Notice the step size (counting in 2s, 5s, 10s, etc.)
4. **Check your work**: Review your answers before submitting
5. **Learn from mistakes**: When you get something wrong, study the correct answer to understand the pattern
6. **Practice regularly**: Generate new questions on the same topic to build fluency
