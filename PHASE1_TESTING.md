# Phase 1 Testing Guide: Question Deduplication

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

**Question Deduplication System** - Prevents students from seeing the same question twice within a configurable time period.

### Features:
- ✅ **Fingerprinting**: Each question gets a unique fingerprint based on content
- ✅ **History Tracking**: Recently seen questions stored in localStorage
- ✅ **Cooldown Period**: Configurable from 1 hour to 1 week (default: 24 hours)
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired entries automatically removed
- ✅ **Settings UI**: Easy-to-use interface for managing history
- ✅ **Statistics**: View how many questions are tracked
- ✅ **Persistence**: History survives browser restarts

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Deduplication

1. **Start fresh**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Click "Clear History" button
   - Confirm the clear action

2. **Generate first batch**:
   - Select "Counting" → Level 1
   - Set to 10 questions
   - Click "Start Practice"
   - **Note down** the questions you see (write down 2-3 questions)
   - Answer all questions (don't need to be correct)

3. **Generate second batch immediately**:
   - Click "Change Topic"
   - Select "Counting" → Level 1 again
   - Set to 10 questions
   - Click "Start Practice"
   - **Verify**: Questions should be completely different from first batch ✓
   - Check console for: "Successfully generated X questions (Y duplicates skipped)"

4. **Generate third batch**:
   - Repeat step 3
   - **Verify**: All new questions again ✓

**Expected Result**: All three batches should have unique questions with no repeats.

### Test 2: Cooldown Period Settings

1. **Change cooldown to 1 hour**:
   - Return to setup screen
   - Change "Question Cooldown" dropdown to "1 hour"
   - Verify console message: "Cooldown period set to 1 hours"

2. **Verify persistence**:
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Check that cooldown selector still shows "1 hour" ✓

3. **Try other periods**:
   - Test setting to: 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 1 week
   - Each change should be saved immediately

### Test 3: History Statistics

1. **View stats before practice**:
   - Click "📊 View Stats" button
   - Should show: "Questions tracked: 0" (if history is clear)

2. **Practice and check stats**:
   - Do a 10-question practice session
   - Return to setup and click "📊 View Stats"
   - **Verify**: Should show "Questions tracked: 10" ✓
   - Should show oldest and newest entry timestamps

3. **Practice again**:
   - Do another 10-question session
   - Check stats: Should show "Questions tracked: 20" (or less if duplicates) ✓

### Test 4: Cross-Module Testing

1. **Test different modules**:
   - Practice "Counting" → 10 questions
   - Practice "Number Bonds" → 10 questions
   - Practice "Multiplication" → 10 questions
   - Practice "Fractions" → 10 questions

2. **Verify stats**:
   - Click "📊 View Stats"
   - Should track questions from all modules ✓

3. **Return to same module**:
   - Practice "Counting" again
   - **Verify**: No repeats from first Counting session ✓

### Test 5: Cross-Level Testing

1. **Test different levels of same module**:
   - "Counting" Level 1 → 5 questions
   - "Counting" Level 2 → 5 questions
   - "Counting" Level 3 → 5 questions
   - "Counting" Level 4 → 5 questions

2. **Verify**:
   - Each level should have unique questions ✓
   - No cross-contamination between levels ✓

### Test 6: Clear History Function

1. **Build up history**:
   - Do 2-3 practice sessions
   - Verify stats show multiple questions tracked

2. **Clear history**:
   - Click "🗑️ Clear History" button
   - Confirm the dialog
   - Should see: "Question history cleared! ✓"

3. **Verify cleared**:
   - Click "📊 View Stats"
   - Should show: "Questions tracked: 0" ✓

4. **Practice again**:
   - Start new session
   - May see previously seen questions (as expected after clearing) ✓

### Test 7: localStorage Persistence

1. **Practice session**:
   - Do a 10-question practice
   - Note down 2-3 questions

2. **Close and reopen browser**:
   - Completely close browser
   - Reopen and navigate back to app

3. **Check persistence**:
   - Click "📊 View Stats" - should still show history ✓
   - Start same module/level - should not see same questions ✓

### Test 8: Console Logging

Open browser console (F12) and monitor messages:

1. **Successful generation**:
   ```
   Successfully generated 10 questions (0 duplicates skipped)
   ```

2. **With duplicates**:
   ```
   Successfully generated 10 questions (3 duplicates skipped)
   ```

3. **Cooldown change**:
   ```
   Cooldown period set to 4 hours
   ```

### Test 9: Edge Cases

**Test 9a: Small question pool**
1. Set cooldown to 1 week
2. Practice "Counting" Level 1 → 20 questions (max)
3. Immediately practice again → 20 questions
4. Keep practicing until you see warning:
   ```
   Only generated X out of 20 requested questions (Y duplicates skipped)
   ```
5. **Verify**: System handles exhausted question pool gracefully ✓

**Test 9b: Single question**
1. Clear history
2. Practice with 1 question
3. Practice again with 1 question
4. **Verify**: Second question is different ✓

**Test 9c: Maximum questions**
1. Practice with 20 questions
2. Check stats - should track all 20 ✓

## ✅ Success Criteria

Phase 1 is successful if:

- [ ] **No duplicate questions** within cooldown period
- [ ] **Cooldown settings** persist across sessions
- [ ] **History statistics** accurately track question count
- [ ] **Clear history** function works correctly
- [ ] **Cross-module** deduplication works
- [ ] **Cross-level** deduplication works
- [ ] **localStorage** persistence works
- [ ] **Console logs** show duplicate skip count
- [ ] **No errors** in browser console
- [ ] **Graceful handling** of exhausted question pools

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "Questions tracked: 0" but I just practiced
- **Solution**: Check if "Clear History" was accidentally clicked

**Issue**: Seeing duplicate questions immediately
- **Solution**: Check console for errors, ensure JavaScript loaded correctly

**Issue**: Stats not persisting after browser restart
- **Solution**: Check if localStorage is enabled, try different browser

**Issue**: "Only generated X out of Y" warning
- **Solution**: Normal if question pool exhausted, clear history or wait for cooldown

**Issue**: Cooldown not changing
- **Solution**: Check console for errors, refresh page

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Monitor these in console:

- **Generation time**: Should still be < 100ms even with history checking
- **Duplicate skip rate**: Typically 10-30% in repeated sessions
- **Storage size**: Check localStorage size (should be < 50KB)

## 🎉 Expected Behavior

**After implementing Phase 1:**
- Students won't see the same questions within 24 hours (or custom period)
- Question variety increases significantly
- Practice sessions feel fresh and engaging
- History automatically cleans up old entries
- System remains fast and responsive

**All tests passing? Phase 1 is complete and ready for Phase 2!** 🚀
