# LLM Build Prompt: UK Maths Practice Application

## Context

I'm building an interactive mathematics practice application for UK Key Stage 1 & 2 students (ages 5-11). The system uses a **parameter-based architecture** to generate differentiated questions at 4 difficulty levels across multiple curriculum topics.

I have three reference artifacts that demonstrate the complete system:

1. **Engineering Documentation** - Complete technical specification with architecture, build guide, and development roadmap
2. **Interactive Student Practice System** - Working student-facing application (HTML/CSS/JS)
3. **Curriculum Parameter System MVP** - Working admin/question generation system

## What I Need You To Build

I need you to help me build a **production-ready version** of this application by:

1. **Starting with the current working system** (as demonstrated in the artifacts)
2. **Refactoring it into a modular, maintainable structure**
3. **Implementing the priority features** one at a time
4. **Following the three-component architecture**: Curriculum â†’ Templates â†’ Delivery

## System Requirements

### Core Principles (CRITICAL)
- âœ… Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks required, but can suggest if beneficial)
- âœ… No complex databases (use localStorage for client-side persistence)
- âœ… No authentication system (keep it simple)
- âœ… Works offline after first load
- âœ… Optimized for iPad/tablet use
- âœ… Must work in modern browsers (Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge)

### Three-Component Architecture

```
CURRICULUM PARAMETERS (JSON data structure)
    â†“
QUESTION TEMPLATES (Generation algorithms)
    â†“
DELIVERY APPLICATION (Student interface)
```

## Step-by-Step Build Instructions

### Phase 0: Foundation Setup

**Task**: Create the modular file structure and set up the base application.

**Deliverables**:
1. Project folder structure (as specified in Engineering Documentation)
2. Separation of concerns: curriculum data, question generators, UI components
3. Base HTML with three main screens: Setup, Practice, Results
4. CSS framework for responsive design
5. Core JavaScript architecture

**Reference**: See "Building the Current System" section in Engineering Documentation

**Questions to answer**:
- Should we use ES6 modules or keep script includes?
- What's the best way to organize the curriculum data?
- How should we structure the question generator registry?

---

### Phase 1: Implement Question Deduplication (PRIORITY 1)

**Goal**: Prevent students from seeing the same question twice within a configurable time period.

**Requirements**:
- Generate unique "fingerprint" for each question based on content
- Track recently seen questions in localStorage
- Add configurable cooldown period (default: 24 hours)
- Settings UI to adjust cooldown (1 hour, 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 1 week)
- When generating questions, skip any seen within cooldown period
- Implement cleanup routine to remove old entries
- Persist history across sessions

**Technical Approach**: See detailed implementation in Engineering Documentation Phase 1

**Deliverables**:
1. `QuestionHistory` class/module with methods:
   - `hasSeenRecently(fingerprint)` â†’ boolean
   - `markAsSeen(fingerprint)` â†’ void
   - `setCooldown(hours)` â†’ void
   - `cleanup()` â†’ void
   - `save()` / `load()` â†’ persistence
2. Modified `QuestionEngine.generate()` to check history
3. Settings panel UI component
4. Unit tests (if applicable)

**Validation**: 
- Generate 20 questions, note which appear
- Immediately generate 20 more â†’ should be completely different
- Wait until after cooldown â†’ previous questions can reappear

**Layout**:
```
[7] [8] [9]
[4] [5] [6]
[1] [2] [3]

  - Show celebration animation
  - Continue practice session seamlessly
- If declined, hide button and continue at current level
- Streak display shows current consecutive correct count
- Power-up only available if not already at max level (Level 4)

**Visual Elements**:
- Streak counter badge (ðŸ”¥ icon when hot streak)
- Floating power-up button (âš¡ icon, gold gradient)
