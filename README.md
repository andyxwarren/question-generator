## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A local web server (required for ES6 modules)

### Installation & Running

#### Option 1: Using the Custom Server (Recommended)

This project includes a custom server script that simplifies the setup process.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory and run the custom server
python custom_server.py
```

This will start the server and provide you with a direct link to open the application.

#### Option 2: Using Node.js

```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

#### Option 3: VS Code Live Server

1. Install "Live Server" extension
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Three-layer parameter-based architecture:
1. **Curriculum Layer** (`parameters.js`) - Defines all modules with 4-level parameters
2. **Generator Layer** (`generators/`) - Pure functions that create questions
3. **Engine & UI Layer** - Orchestration, validation, and rendering

## ü§ù Contributing

New curriculum modules can be added by:
1. Defining parameters in `src/curriculum/parameters.js`
2. Creating a generator in `src/generators/`
3. Registering the generator in `src/core/questionEngine.js`

See [TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md](TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed instructions.
